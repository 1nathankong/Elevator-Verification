# Elevator-Verification (Arduino Uno)

Created an automated elevator system using digital logic principles, verified in software, and implemented on physical hardware. 

## Design Process

1. ** Logic Design **: Start by designing truth table for transitions.
2. ** FSM **: Derived FSM from truth table
3. ** Software verification **: Implemented prototype logic on Python and wrote a testbench to validate before taping out on Arduino Uno
4. ** Physical implementation **: Rewrote logic with C++ code, and then integrated with Arduino Uno, IR sensors, and 7 segment digit display.
